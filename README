My original Akuji the Demon translation was produced in January or February
of 2003. These tools were written LONG after the fact in September of that
year.

The purpose is simple, one file extracts all the graphics from the QDA
resource Akuji uses, the other makes a new QDA format file using the contents
of whatever directory you give it.

This could be handy if you want to customize the graphics in the game, or if
you decide you want to waste your time producing a third (yes, third)
translation of the game because mine and the other don't suck enough.
